## ðŸš€ About Me

Hi guys ! I'm Mephisto and Im a French guy __(don't hate me because im baguette)__ that loves IT, Coding and Innovating in the things that surrounds me !

Most of the time i'm "Idea guy" and never a "doer" you know? but for once i'll be doing some things ... hoefully ðŸ™„


Anyways, here I will have a couple projects that I consider as **FINISHED** or maybe **WIP** ðŸ‘€

(even though most of ther time they're are far from what I wanted to do lol)

# I'm dog water at coding, I know

I consider myself as a beginner even after a couple years ( I never get out of my comfortable zone lol )

I know my code is not optimized or anything but i'm having fun making these little projects but


IF you have some tips and tricks to help me learn I will gladly take them.
We must help each other learn in this community right, guys????
